# ComfyUI EasyNoobAI

> [!WARNING]
> All of the list used in this node are very large and can take a long time to generate. Please be patient when using this node. I am currently limited this to about 0.025% of the total list size which is equal to about 5000-6000 entries
> If dont see your favor character or artist, you can recompile the list with the script I have provided in the assets folder. You can create a new characters list by running `py noobai-list-convert.py -i danbooru_character_webui.csv -o characters.py -n CHARACTERS -t 0.05 -d` as
> and example. This will give you a file called `characters.py` which will need to be moved to the src folder...and comfyui restarted. You will need to use the flag `-n [NAME]` on all the files and you will need to match naming conventions that are being looked for in the
> scripts. for `-n CHARACTERS -o characters.py` or `-n ARTISTS -o artists.py` or `-n E621_CHARACTERS -p e62_characters.py`. you should back up all files before replacing them. Know that you will need to `stash` your changes before you can pull and update for the node

## TOOLS
The lists for the characters and artists are based on the tags from Danbooru and E621. Are massive, so I am currently limiting it to about 0.25% of the top tags. This is roughly about 5000-6000 entries for each list. If you find it to be too large or small, you can use the `noobai-list-convert.py` in the assets folder to convert the list to a smaller or larger list. This is a CLI and needs to be in the same folder as the csv files.
You need to run these under a environment that has inquirer, tqdm, and colorama installed. You can install these by running `pip install inquirer tqdm colorama` in the terminal under a python environment.

## Usage

Character/Artist (Overload Nodes)

These nodes are used to add multiple characters and artists to the prompt based on the tags from Danbooru and E621. The tags are separated by a comma.
You are limited to 5 characters and 5 artists per prompt, but you can always add more by chaining the nodes.

Hairstyles and Clothing
These nodes are used to ... well added known hairstyles and clothing that have been tested by other AI Artist.
